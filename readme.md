# Override Default Tab

**** WORK IN PROGRESS **** 

Chrome Extension designed to remove specific tabs that are opened. I encountered a scenario where my browser was managed 
and I was coerced to open a set of tabs to my companies new and coop pages. This hindered my development loop so I came 
up with this little diddy to remove those tabs.
